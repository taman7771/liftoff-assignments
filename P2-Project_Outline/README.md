## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Developing an app for my Church’s Kid’s ministry. They have several events, gatherings and summer camps throughout the year. I observed a loose system on kids registration for events and gatherings. I want to implement a system that allows parents first to login into the app and register their children for events and on the events a check-in and check-out system to easily drop off and pick up their kids of their sessions. 

Another problem is resources are unknown and underutilized. So I want to categorize resources and put a mechanism for searching resources per their age group and also a platform for parents to purchase resources using the app.

Also to have a data base for saving the information of the kids attending, username (it could be an email) and passwords of parents and event organizers, data base of resources.
