### Overview

  Not all campsites are created equal. For example, the private site with river access and a view versus the crowded site next to the dump station. Which is why my family has kept a folder full of campground maps with notes scribbled in the margins since before I was born. However, over that amount of time some maps have become illegible or simply lost. Which is why it is time for a digital solution, Best Campsite!
  Users will be able to login, search campgrounds, and mark campsites according to their tastes. Everyone has different judgement criteria for campsites. Which is why when marking sites users can write a brief description to remind themselves why they marked it in the first place. Then when a user is ready to plan their next trip they can go their user page to review their marked sites.
  
### Features

User Login: Users can create accounts, login, and a user page to review marked sites.
Campground Search: Users can search with a map interface and select campgrounds.
Mark Site: Users can view a list of all campsites and rate them as they see fit.

### Overview
Developing an app for my Church’s Kid’s ministry. They have several events, gatherings and summer camps throughout the year. I observed a loose system on kids registration for events and gatherings. I want to implement a system that allows parents first to login into the app and register their children for events and on the events a check-in and check-out system to easily drop off and pick up their kids of their sessions. 

Another problem is resources are unknown and underutilized. So I want to categorize resources and put a mechanism for searching resources per their age group and also a platform for parents to purchase resources using the app.

Also to have a data base for saving the information of the kids attending, username (it could be an email) and passwords of parents and event organizers, data base of resources.

### Features
•	User login
•	Email confirmation
•	Html Forms submission
•	Save and querying database through usernames, emails and resources

### Technologies
•	Java
•	Spring Boot Framework
•	MySQL
•	SQLAlchemy

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how I can use my java, SQL and html skills to implement this project and bring it to fruition. I am also excited how this turns up to end and have a skill of software developer.
